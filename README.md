# IAN-R1-openmc
# Overview
This repository contains an OpenMC model of the IAN-R1 research reactor. The IAN-R1 is a pool-type, light-water moderated and cooled reactor located at the Instituto de Asuntos Nucleares in Bogot√°, Colombia. Commissioned in 1965, the unit operates at a rated thermal power of 30 kW for research, isotope production, and academic training.
The purpose of this repository is to replicate the IAN-R1 geometry, materials, and operating conditions in OpenMC, achieving the highest possible fidelity, and to provide a reusable and documented model for research and educational purposes.
